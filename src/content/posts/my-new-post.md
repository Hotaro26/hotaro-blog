# Hey, I'm Hotaro ヾ(≧▽≦*)o

teenage dev · anime enjoyer · arch user · music nerd

Just a teenager who recently survived high school and came out the other side with a diploma,
a few unfinished side projects, and a serious sleep debt. (￣▽￣)ノ

## ( ´ ▽ ` ) What I'm Into

<div style="display:grid; grid-template-columns:1fr 1fr; gap:1rem; margin:1.5rem 0;">

<div style="border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px; padding:1rem;">

**Coding**

I build things, break them, then spend three hours figuring out why.
Whatever looks interesting enough to keep me up past midnight.

</div>

<div style="border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px; padding:1rem;">

**Arch Linux**

Yes, I use Arch. No, I won't stop mentioning it.
`btw` — reinstalled it four times and counting. (¬‿¬)

</div>

<div style="border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px; padding:1rem;">

**Anime**

My watchlist has more entries than my git commits.
Currently watching whatever hits hardest. (｡•̀ᴗ-)✧

</div>

<div style="border:1px solid #333; border-radius:8px; padding:1rem;">

**Music**

Headphones on, world off. Lo-fi while coding,
full soundtrack mode during late-night sessions.

</div>

## (*・ω・)ノ This Blog

This is my quiet corner of the internet. I write about whatever's on my mind —
experiences, things I'm learning, random thoughts, and probably some anime opinions
nobody asked for.

No algorithm. No ads. Just writing. (＾▽＾)
